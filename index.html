                        <p>Hello, my name is Sam and I am a beginner programmer learning through CodeCademy!</p>
                        <p>Before I started to learn coding I studied pharmaceutical sciences, my background has been mainly in sciences and maths for most of my life. However, my passion has always been with computers!</p>
                        <p>During my spare time I like to spend my time walking my dogs, socialising with my good friends and reading any of my books. I have a sizeable selection of fantasy novels that I love to read whenever I have the chance.</p>
